<h1>Say Cheese!</h1>
<br>This project is a frontend web application that recreates the experience of flipping through photos on a personal digital camera, translated into a modern web interface. 
<br><br>The goal was to preserve the behavior: simple, directional navigation through a fixed set of images, mirroring the experience of using a physical camera rather than a traditional photo gallery.
<br><br>Alongside my systems and embedded work, this project demonstrates my ability to design intentional user-facing interfaces, translate physical interaction patterns into software, manage user interface state cleanly, and ship a polished frontend product end-to-end.  

<h2>Features</h2>
<b>Directional photo navigation</b><br>
Photos are navigated using left and right controls that map directly to physical camera arrow buttons, preserving the original camera interaction model.

<br><b>Responsive layout</b><br>
The viewer adapts across desktop and mobile screen sizes while maintaining the proportions and visual feel of a camera display.

<b>Client-side state management</b><br>
Photo navigation state and user interface updates are managed entirely in the browser using React state, allowing instant interaction without backend dependencies.

<b>Deployed production build</b><br>
The application is deployed on Vercel with continuous deployment via GitHub.

<h2>Technical Overview</h2>
<b>Framework</b> <br>React + Next.js <br>
<br><b>State Management</b><br> Client-side React state for photo navigation and user interface updates<br>
<br><b>Styling</b><br> CSS with responsive scaling and layout constraints<br>
<br><b>Deployment</b><br> Vercel (production build and static asset handling)<br>
<br>The project focuses intentionally on frontend concerns: user interaction behavior, layout precision, state management, and deployment.

<h2>Design Inspiration</h2>
At seven years old, I was gifted the first piece of personal technology I had ever owned: a bright green Kodak Easyshare C143 digital camera. I was immediately enamored with it, carrying it everywhere I went, and clicking pictures that have now become precious memories. 
<br><br>This camera was one of my earliest independent explorations of technology. Long before I understood software, this camera sparked my curiosity, leading to many exclamations of “how does this work?” and a growing desire to understand the systems behind the devices I used.
<br><br>Nearly 16 years later, I wanted a way to archive and revisit the photos taken without losing the intentional feeling of flipping through the camera itself.
